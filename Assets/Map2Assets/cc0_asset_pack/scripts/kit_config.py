kit_config.py -- every tunable in the pack, in one place.

This is the ONLY file you should need to edit to re-roll the whole kit at a
different scale, wall height, or level of edge detail. Nothing else in the
codebase should contain a hard-coded dimension.

Units are metres. 1 m = 1 Blender unit = 100 Unreal units = 1 Unity unit.

Usage:
    import kit_config as cfg
    cfg.MODULE          # 4.0

    # or start from a preset
